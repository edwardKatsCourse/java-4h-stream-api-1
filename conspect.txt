1. Why ?
- example before Stream API
- example after	Stream API

2. terminology
- source 
- pipe (operations)
- collectors (sink, actions) | aggregators

3. Optional
------------------------
Stream API
- Stream != Collection
Stream does not keep the data

- Streams are immutable
- Stream API helps in multithreading
- Stream can be used only once
Cannot reuse. 
For each new operation it is necessary to create a new Stream object
